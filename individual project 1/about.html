                            <p>Hi my name is Christian Berko and I am a Web and Mobile Computing Major here at RIT. I also
                                am the captain of the mens tennis team here at RIT.  Silver Spring Maryland is my hometown and
                                is the place I call home.  Silver Spring has about 81,000 residents making it a medium sized town.
                                The diversity and close proximity to essential things are what makes it a great place to live.</p>
