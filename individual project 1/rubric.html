                        <h1>Rubric</h1>
                        <h2>Organization of information/CRAP</h2>
                        <ul class = "rubricList">
                            <li>Text is descriptive and the graphics to a good job to help with the flow. For example the background of the restaurants page and parks page are both trees.
                                The idea with the tree as a background is to give the vibe of the outdoors along with the text being on a beige kind of color to contrast the green background.  
                                The Downtown Silver Spring Pageâ€™s background is a photo of downtown Silver Spring at night to match the content of the page which is about downtown.
                            </li>
                            <li>In terms of CRAP, there is good contrast on the page, each of the pages contains the same round container, though it varies in size due to the amount of content that is in it.  
                                Each pages also has the same fonts and weights for headings and then the same font size and headings for the texts as well.  These are repeated to keep the theme simple and uniform throughout the site.  
                                As for alignment and proximity, the images throughout the site are very close to the text which makes it easy to decipher what image you are looking at and what text it belongs to 
                                    
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Content</h2>
                        <ul class = "rubricList">
                            <li>Content is easy to read and not to dense. The text goes along with the images quite well and contain no spelling or grammar errors.</li>
                        
                        </ul>
                        <h2>Navigation</h2>
                        <ul class = "rubricList">
                            <li>The menu is a simple flex menu at the top.  The links highlight red in the color and with a red bottom border to indicate the page that your cursor is currently on.  
                                The links themselves a are labeled in a way that the users knows what pages they are going to when clicked Due to the short length of my pages, I did not find it necessary for 
                                a back to top button because the pages where not of a great length.  The seal of Maryland is right next to the nav on each page.
                            </li>
